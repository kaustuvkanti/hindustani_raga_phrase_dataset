# Hindustani Raga Phrase Dataset 

This repository hosts the dataset designed to test melodic phrase shape characterization methodologies on Hindustani raga music. It is composed of 12 recordings from ragas Deshkar and Bhupali in [CompMusic Project](http://compmusic.upf.edu/)'s [Dunya](http://dunya.compmusic.upf.edu/) Hindustani Music collection.

Please cite the publication below, if you use this dataset in your work:

The recordings are selected from commercial recordings carefully such that they cover diverse musical forms, vocal settings, and recording qualities (e.g. historical vs contemporary spanning over six decades). Most of the recordings in the dataset are identified by a 16-character long unique identifier called MBID, hosted in [MusicBrainz](http://musicbrainz.org).

The audio-related data in the test dataset is organized by each raga in the folder "data". Due to copyright reasons, we are unable to distribute all the audio. Instead, we provide the MBIDs or YouTube links. For more information, please contact the authors.

Erratum

We are currently verifying the annotations for boundary precision. This is more aligned to do with the publishing of the dataset and doe not relate to the analysis reported in the article.
